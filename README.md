# Overview
S.P.I.N.E. is a decentralized power distribution architecture that splits control, distribution, and protection into discrete, stackable modules. Offers control over individual power rails, intelligent fault propagation, and telemetry via standard industrial buses.

# System Architecture
The system is composed of three primary module types, functioning analogously to a biological nervous system:

## 1. Cortex (Main Control Unit)
The Cortex is responsible for high-level decision-making and external communication.

- Bus Monitoring: Continuously monitors the main bus voltage.

- Orchestration: Controls the state of all connected Vertebra modules via RS485.

- Telemetry: Send internal system data to the external robot controller via CAN Bus.

## 2. Vertebra (Power Distribution & Switching)
Each Vertebra acts as an intelligent Power Distribution Unit (PDU).

- Distribution: Takes 1 main input and splits it into 3 protected outputs.

- Protection Topology: Utilizes a back-to-back switching topology to enable full bidirectional cutoff.

- Soft Start: Integrated Precharge circuit to prevent inrush current spikes during startup.

- Sensing: Real-time current sensing on outputs.

- Fault Propagation:

  - Local: Can autonomously cut power upon detecting over-current events.
  
  - Global: A "Critical Fault" in one Vertebra triggers a system-wide shutdown protocol to protect the rest of the hardware.

## 3. Disc (Brake Chopper)
A purely hardware-based protection module.

- Function: Dissipates dangerous back-EMF (voltage spikes) generated by motors during rapid deceleration.

- Mechanism: A fast analog comparator circuit to trigger a dump load when voltage exceeds a set threshold.

- Zero-Latency: No microcontroller or software intervention required; purely reactive hardware protection.
